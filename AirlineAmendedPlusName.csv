681449012,United,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service

681449047,United,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
681449048,United,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient

681449087,United,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
681449088,United,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
681449089,United,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
681449090,United,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
681449091,United,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.

681449098,United,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
681449099,United,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys

681449108,United,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
681449109,United,@united Thank you.
681449110,United,@united Blackmailed me into paying �130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
681449111,United,@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
681449112,United,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  �Ε�out.

681449116,United,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
681449117,United,@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
681449118,United,@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
681449119,United,@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
681449120,United,"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
681449121,United,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
681449122,United,@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
681449123,United,"@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey"
681449124,United,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
681449125,United,"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
681449126,United,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
681449127,United,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
681449128,United,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
681449129,United,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
681449130,United,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
681449131,United,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
681449132,United,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
681449133,United,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.

681449135,United,@united please be good to me this weekend!
681449136,United,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
681449137,United,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
681449138,United,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
681449139,United,@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
681449140,United,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
681449141,United,@united yall should probably work on that.
681449142,United,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
681449143,United,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
681449144,United,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
681449145,United,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.

681449167,United,@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
681449168,United,@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
681449169,United,@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
681449170,United,@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
681449171,United,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
681449172,United,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
681449173,United,@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
681449174,United,.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
681449175,United,"@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round"
681449176,United,"@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?"
681449177,United,@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
681449178,United,@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
681449179,United,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
681449180,United,@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc̩e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
681449181,United,@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
681449182,United,@united thnx for the info
681449183,United,@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher

681449193,United,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
681449194,United,@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
681449195,United,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
681449196,United,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
681449197,United,@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
681449198,United,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"

681449200,United,@united Okay thank you
681449201,United,@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
681449202,United,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
681449203,United,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
681449204,United,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
681449205,United,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
681449206,United,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
681449207,United,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
681449208,United,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
681449209,United,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka

681449212,United,@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
681449213,United,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight

681449216,United,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
681449217,United,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
681449218,United,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
681449220,United,"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
681449221,United,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
681449223,United,@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
681449224,United,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
681449226,United,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
681449228,United,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
681449229,United,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
681449231,United,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
681449233,United,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
681449235,United,@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
681449236,United,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
681449238,United,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
681449239,United,@united you are one great airline �_�

681449248,United,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
681449250,United,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...

681449262,United,@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
681449264,United,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
681449267,United,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
681449269,United,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
681449270,United,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
681449272,United,@united yes I do.

681449275,United,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
681449277,United,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
681449278,United,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
681449280,United,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
681449282,United,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
681449283,United,@united Deep Vein thrombosis
681449285,United,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"

681449298,United,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
681449299,United,@united DM sent
681449301,United,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
681449303,United,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
681449304,United,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
681449306,United,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
681449307,United,@united But thanks for asking
681449309,United,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
681449310,United,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
681449312,United,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
681449314,United,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."

681449329,United,@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
681449331,United,@united why would they make me share a room?
681449333,United,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
681449334,United,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
681449336,United,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
681449338,United,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
681449339,United,"@united i understand, thanks"
681449341,United,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
681449343,United,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
681449344,United,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
681449346,United,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
681449347,United,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
681449350,United,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
681449351,United,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
681449353,United,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
681449355,United,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
681449356,United,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
681449358,United,"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
681449359,United,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
681449361,United,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
681449363,United,@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
681449364,United,"@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?"
681449367,United,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
681449368,United,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
681449370,United,@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
681449372,United,@united I hope so too
681449373,United,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
681449375,United,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
681449377,United,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
681449378,United,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
681449380,United,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
681449382,United,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
681449383,United,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
681449385,United,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
681449387,United,@united where is my flight voucher?
681449388,United,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
681449390,United,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
681449392,United,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
681449394,United,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
681449396,United,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
681449398,United,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
681449400,United,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
681449402,United,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
681449403,United,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
681449405,United,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
681449407,United,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! _٪ #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
681449408,United,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
681449410,United,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
681449411,United,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
681449413,United,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
681449415,United,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
681449416,United,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
681449419,United,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
681449421,United,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
681449422,United,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
681449424,United,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
681449425,United,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated�my time wasted (2/2)
681449427,United,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
681449429,United,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
681449430,United,@united That's correct�I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
681449432,United,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
681449434,United,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
681449436,United,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
681449437,United,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
681449439,United,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
681449440,United,"@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes"
681449442,United,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
681449443,United,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your controlthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
681449444,United,@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
681449446,United,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
681449447,United,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
681449449,United,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
681449451,United,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
681449453,United,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
681449455,United,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
681449456,United,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
681449458,United,@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
681449460,United,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
681449461,United,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"

681449472,United,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
681449474,United,@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP what's the point of membership?

681449558,United,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
681449560,United,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
681449561,United,@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!

681449579,United,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"

681449590,United,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
681449591,United,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
681449592,United,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
681449593,United,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
681449595,United,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!

681449659,United,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
681449661,United,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
681449662,United,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
681449664,United,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
681449666,United,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
681449667,United,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
681449668,United,@united done
681449669,United,"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
681449672,United,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
681449674,United,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
681449675,United,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
681449677,United,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
681449679,United,@united thank you
681449680,United,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
681449682,United,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
681449684,United,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
681449686,United,@united he has no priority and Iove it
681449687,United,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
681449690,United,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
681449691,United,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
681449693,United,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley _�_�_�
681449694,United,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
681449696,United,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
681449698,United,"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
681449700,United,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
681449702,United,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
681449704,United,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
681449705,United,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
681449707,United,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
681449709,United,Thank you �@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH�۝
681449710,United,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
681449712,United,"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
681449714,United,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
681449716,United,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
681449717,United,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
681449719,United,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
681449721,United,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
681449722,United,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
681449725,United,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
681449727,United,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
681449729,United,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
681449730,United,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
681449733,United,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
681449734,United,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
681449736,United,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
681449737,United,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
681449738,United,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
681449739,United,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
681449741,United,.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
681449742,United,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
681449744,United,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
681449746,United,@united Ok thank again for your help!
681449747,United,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
681449749,United,Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
681449751,United,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
681449752,United,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
681449754,United,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
681449756,United,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
681449757,United,"@united This must be a drone �@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
681449759,United,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
681449761,United,@united flight attendant doesn�۪t understand not understanding English doesn�۪t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
681449763,United,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
681449765,United,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
681449766,United,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents _�
681449768,United,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
681449770,United,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
681449771,United,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
681449773,United,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
681449775,United,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
681449777,United,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
681449779,United,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
681449780,United,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
681449782,United,"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
681449784,United,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
681449785,United,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
681449787,United,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
681449789,United,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
681449790,United,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous

681449802,United,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
681449804,United,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
681449805,United,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
681449807,United,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
681449809,United,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"

681449816,United,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
681449818,United,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
681449819,United,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
681449822,United,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
681449823,United,@united ok thx!

681449839,United,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
681449840,United,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
681449842,United,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
681449844,United,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
681449845,United,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
681449847,United,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
681449849,United,@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?

681449857,United,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
681449859,United,@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.

681449982,United,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
681449984,United,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
681449986,United,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
681449988,United,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
681449989,United,@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
681449991,United,@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
681449993,United,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
681449995,United,@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? _�_
681449996,United,@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
681449998,United,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
681450000,United,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
681450002,United,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
681450004,United,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
681450006,United,@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
681450007,United,"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
681450009,United,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
681450011,United,"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
681450012,United,@united Ha�_ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
681450014,United,@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
681450016,United,@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
681450017,United,@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
681450019,United,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
681450020,United,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
681450022,United,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
681450024,United,@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
681450025,United,@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
681450027,United,"@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?"
681450029,United,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
681450030,United,@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
681450032,United,@united please see dm!!
681450034,United,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
681450035,United,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
681450037,United,@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
681450039,United,@united still no response??
681450041,United,@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
681450042,United,@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
681450044,United,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
681450046,United,@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
681450047,United,@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
681450049,United,@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?

681450057,United,"@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way"
681450060,United,@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
681450062,United,@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
681450063,United,@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
681450065,United,"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
681450066,United,"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."

681450163,United,"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."

681450229,United,"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
681450230,United,@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
681450231,United,@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
681450232,United,"@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage."
681450233,United,@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
681450234,United,"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
681450235,United,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
681450236,United,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
681450237,United,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
681450238,United,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
681450239,United,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
681450240,United,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
681450241,United,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
681450242,United,@united I wanna be grand staff
681450243,United,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
681450244,United,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
681450245,United,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
681450246,United,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
681450247,United,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
681450248,United,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
681450249,United,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
681450250,United,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
681450251,United,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
681450252,United,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don�۪t see that it has taken off yet"
681450253,United,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
681450254,United,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
681450255,United,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
681450256,United,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
681450257,United,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
681450258,United,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
681450259,United,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
681450260,United,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
681450261,United,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
681450262,United,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
681450263,United,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
681450264,United,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
681450265,United,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
681450266,United,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
681450268,United,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
681450269,United,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
681450270,United,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
681450271,United,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
681450272,United,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
681450273,United,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
681450274,United,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
681450275,United,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
681450276,United,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
681450277,United,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
681450278,United,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
681450279,United,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
681450281,United,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
681450282,United,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
681450283,United,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
681450284,United,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
681450285,United,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
681450286,United,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
681450287,United,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
681450288,United,@united it will be on a different airline.
681450289,United,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
681450290,United,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
681450291,United,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
681450292,United,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
681450293,United,@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
681450294,United,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
681450295,United,@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
681450296,United,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
681450297,United,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
681450298,United,@united i need help but in spanish
681450299,United,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
681450300,United,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
681450301,United,@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
681450302,United,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
681450303,United,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
681450304,United,@united UA1469. Just landed.
681450305,United,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
681450306,United,@united flight 435
681450307,United,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
681450308,United,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
681450309,United,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
681450310,United,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
681450311,United,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
681450312,United,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
681450313,United,@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
681450314,United,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
681450315,United,"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
681450316,United,@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
681450317,United,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
681450318,United,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
681450319,United,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
681450320,United,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
681450321,United,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
681450322,United,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
681450323,United,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
681450324,United,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
681450325,United,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
681450326,United,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
681450327,United,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
681450328,United,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
681450329,United,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
681450330,United,@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
681450331,United,@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
681450332,United,@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
681450333,United,"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
681450334,United,"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
681450335,United,@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
681450336,United,@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z
681450337,United,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
681450338,United,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
681450339,United,@united thank you!
681450340,United,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
681450341,United,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
681450342,United,@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
681450343,United,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
681450344,United,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
681450345,United,@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
681450346,United,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
681450347,United,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
681450348,United,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
681450349,United,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
681450350,United,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
681450351,United,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
681450352,United,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
681450353,United,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
681450354,United,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
681450355,United,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
681450356,United,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
681450357,United,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
681450358,United,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
681450359,United,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
681450360,United,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
681450361,United,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
681450362,United,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
681450363,United,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
681450364,United,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
681450365,United,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from Ṣo Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
681450366,United,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
681450367,United,@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
681450368,United,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
681450369,United,@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
681450370,United,@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
681450371,United,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
681450372,United,@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
681450373,United,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
681450374,United,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
681450375,United,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
681450376,United,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
681450377,United,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
681450378,United,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
681450379,United,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
681450380,United,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
681450381,United,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
681450382,United,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
681450383,United,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
681450384,United,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
681450385,United,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
681450386,United,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
681450387,United,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
681450389,United,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
681450390,United,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
681450391,United,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
681450392,United,@united lol too little too Late Flight
681450393,United,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
681450394,United,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
681450395,United,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
681450396,United,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
681450397,United,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
681450398,United,@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
681450399,United,@united your seats are god awful.
681450400,United,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
681450401,United,@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
681450402,United,@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
681450403,United,@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
681450404,United,"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
681450405,United,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
681450406,United,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
681450407,United,@united i sure will
681450408,United,@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
681450409,United,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
681450410,United,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
681450411,United,@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home _٪�_٪�
681450412,United,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
681450413,United,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
681450414,United,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
681450415,United,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
681450416,United,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
681450417,United,@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
681450418,United,@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
681450419,United,@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
681450420,United,@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
681450421,United,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
681450422,United,@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
681450423,United,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."

681450456,United,@united why do you hate your passengers?
681450457,United,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
681450458,United,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
681450459,United,@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR

681450593,United,"@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem."

681450598,United,@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.

681450607,United,@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
681450609,United,@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar

681450640,United,"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."

681450662,United,@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
681450665,United,@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
681450667,United,@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
681450669,United,@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing

681450686,United,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
681450688,United,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
681450690,United,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy

681450711,United,@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
681450712,United,"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
681450714,United,@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
681450716,United,@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
681450718,United,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l

681450741,United,@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
681450743,United,@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..

681450759,United,@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
681450761,United,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
681450763,United,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
681450765,United,@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.

681450856,United,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate

681450860,United,"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"

681450869,United,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
681450872,United,@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
681450873,United,@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
681450875,United,@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?

681450890,United,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"

681450940,United,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
681450943,United,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!

681451087,United,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!

681451162,United,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
681451164,United,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
681451166,United,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
681451168,United,@united fuck you for not caring _�

681451279,United,"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"

681451282,United,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
681451283,United,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
681451284,United,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
681451285,United,@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
681451286,United,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
681451287,United,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
681451288,United,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
681451289,United,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
681451290,United,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
681451291,United,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
681451292,United,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
681451293,United,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
681451294,United,@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
681451295,United,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
681451296,United,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
681451297,United,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550

681451317,United,@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
681451318,United,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
681451319,United,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.

681451393,United,@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
681451394,United,@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
681451395,United,@united can you make sure I�۪m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
681451396,United,@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
681451397,United,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
681451398,United,@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
681451399,United,"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
681451400,United,@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
681451401,United,"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
681451402,United,"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
681451403,United,@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
681451404,United,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
681451405,United,"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
681451406,United,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
681451407,United,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
681451408,United,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
681451409,United,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
681451410,United,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
681451411,United,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
681451412,United,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
681451413,United,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
681451414,United,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
681451415,United,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
681451416,United,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
681451417,United,@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
681451418,United,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
681451419,United,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
681451420,United,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
681451421,United,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
681451422,United,@united U blow
681451423,United,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
681451424,United,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
681451425,United,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
681451426,United,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
681451427,United,@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
681451428,United,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
681451429,United,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
681451430,United,@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
681451431,United,@united you're terrible.
681451432,United,@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
681451433,United,@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
681451434,United,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
681451435,United,"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
681451436,United,@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
681451437,United,@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
681451438,United,@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
681451439,United,@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
681451440,United,@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
681451441,United,@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
681451442,United,@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
681451443,United,@united and waiting
681451444,United,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
681451445,United,@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
681451447,United,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
681451448,United,"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
681451449,United,@united is the worst
681451450,United,@united still waiting
681451451,United,"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
681451452,United,"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
681451453,United,"@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?"
681451454,United,@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
681451455,United,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
681451456,United,@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
681451457,United,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
681451458,United,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
681451459,United,@united following
681451460,United,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
681451461,United,@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
681451462,United,@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
681451463,United,@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
681451464,United,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
681451465,United,@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!
681451466,United,@united could really use your help getting our bags at IAD. We're headed to YOW but now going to YXU

681451468,United,@united And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems

681451473,United,@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
681451474,United,"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
681451475,United,@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
681451476,United,@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies

681451484,United,@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
681451485,United,@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.

681451488,United,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
681451489,United,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
681451490,United,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
681451491,United,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
681451492,United,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
681451493,United,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
681451494,United,@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
681451495,United,@united never again.
681451496,United,@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
681451497,United,@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
681451498,United,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
681451499,United,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
681451500,United,@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
681451501,United,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
681451502,United,@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
681451503,United,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
681451504,United,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
681451505,United,@united sucks.
681451506,United,@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
681451507,United,@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
681451508,United,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
681451509,United,@united where's the crew for ua748?
681451510,United,@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
681451511,United,@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
681451512,United,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
681451513,United,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
681451514,United,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
681451515,United,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
681451516,United,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
681451517,United,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
681451518,United,@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
681451519,United,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
681451520,United,"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"
681451521,United,@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
681451522,United,@united thanks
681451523,United,"@united hey, I missed my outbound flight - can I still use my return ticket?"
681451524,United,@united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
681451525,United,@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
681451526,United,@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
681451527,United,@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
681451528,United,@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.

681451530,United,@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
681451531,United,@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
681451532,United,@united - any way to get a message to an international flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
681451533,United,@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
681451534,United,@united you have a culture issue
681451535,United,@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
681451536,United,@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
681451537,United,@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
681451538,United,@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
681451539,United,@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
681451540,United,@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
681451541,United,"@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!"

681451545,United,"@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?"
681451546,United,@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling internationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
681451547,United,@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?

681451555,United,@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
681451556,United,@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
681451557,United,"@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags"
681451558,United,"@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
681451559,United,@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
681451560,United,@united no wheelchairs
681451561,United,"@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance"
681451562,United,@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
681451563,United,@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
681451564,United,"@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations"
681451565,United,@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
681451566,United,"@united thanks, we did."
681451567,United,"@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me."
681451568,United,@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
681451569,United,@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!

681451587,United,@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
681451588,United,@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
681451589,United,@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
681451590,United,@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
681451591,United,@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
681451592,United,@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
681451593,United,@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail

681451834,United,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
681451836,United,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
681451838,United,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
681451840,United,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
681451842,United,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.

681451870,United,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."

681451874,United,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
681451876,United,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.

681451902,United,@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
681451904,United,@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
681451906,United,@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6

681451924,United,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
681451926,United,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"
681451928,United,@united First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? http://t.co/1TFH2v0a7z
681451930,United,@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
681451932,United,@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
681451934,United,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
681451936,United,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
681451939,United,@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual

681452332,United,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
681452333,United,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
681452334,United,@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
681452335,United,@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
681452336,United,@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
681452337,United,"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"

681452342,United,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
681452343,United,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"

681452492,United,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...

681452526,United,"@united well played, ^LO."
681452527,United,@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.

681452550,United,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
681452551,United,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
681452552,United,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx

681452555,United,@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
681452556,United,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
681452557,United,@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.

681452780,United,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
681452781,United,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
681452782,United,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable

681452813,United,@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
681452814,United,@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm

681452826,United,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
681452827,United,@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
681452828,United,"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""

681452849,United,@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
681452851,United,"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
681452852,United,@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
681452854,United,".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"

Frustrating!"
681452937,United,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place

681453402,United,@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
681453404,United,@united Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -&gt; IAD. Is there any way to check if upgrades are available?

681453438,United,@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
681453439,United,"@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!"
681453442,United,@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
681453444,United,"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
681453445,United,@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
681453447,United,@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
681453448,United,@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier &amp; I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
681453450,United,@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
681453452,United,@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?

681453460,United,"@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
681453463,United,@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
681453465,United,"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
681453466,United,@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
681453468,United,@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
681453470,United,@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.

681453475,United,"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"
681453477,United,@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
681453478,United,@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
681453480,United,@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
681453482,United,@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
681453483,United,"@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!"
681453485,United,@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
681453487,United,@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
681453489,United,"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
681453491,United,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
681453493,United,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
681453496,United,@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
681453498,United,"@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!"

681453579,United,"@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times."
681453580,United,"@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?"
681453582,United,@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
681453583,United,@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?

681453596,United,@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren�۪t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
681453598,United,@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
681453600,United,@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
681453601,United,"@united It was quite enjoyable. _�_ 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. _�"

681453616,United,@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.

681453630,United,@united sent
681453632,United,@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
681453634,United,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
681453635,United,"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
681453636,United,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"
681453638,United,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
681453640,United,@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
681453641,United,"@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???"

681453669,United,@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
681453671,United,@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
681453673,United,@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
681453674,United,@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07

681453729,United,"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"
681453730,United,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
681453731,United,@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
681453732,United,"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?"
681453733,United,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
681453734,United,@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
681453735,United,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
681453736,United,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
681453737,United,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
681453738,United,"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."
681453739,United,@united thank you!
681453740,United,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
681453741,United,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
681453742,United,"@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found."
681453743,United,@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad

681453750,United,@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
681453751,United,@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
681453752,United,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn�۪t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
681453753,United,@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
681453754,United,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
681453755,United,"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
681453756,United,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
681453757,United,"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"

681453782,United,@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
681453783,United,@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
681453784,United,@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
681453785,United,@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.

681453920,United,@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
681453921,United,@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
681453922,United,"@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac."
681453923,United,@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
681453924,United,@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
681453925,United,@united how come I have no baggage updates.
681453926,United,"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"
681453927,United,@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
681453928,United,"@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?"

681453930,United,@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
681453931,United,@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
681453932,United,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
681453933,United,@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
681453934,United,"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"
681453935,United,"@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will turn 2 during the trip do I have to buy a return ticket for my child?"
681453936,United,@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
681453937,United,@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
681453938,United,@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
681453939,United,"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
681453940,United,"@united unless it's on you guys, im good."
681453941,United,@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
681453942,United,"@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!"
681453943,United,"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."
681453944,United,@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
681453945,United,@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
681453946,United,@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
681453947,United,@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
681453948,United,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
681453949,United,@united so if this game was the one reason I payed for @DIRECTV is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/HQDTK6aTue
681453950,United,@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD

681453952,United,"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"
681453953,United,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
681453954,United,@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
681453955,United,@united do you guys have any working planes?
681453956,United,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
681453957,United,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won�۪t fix it."
681453958,United,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
681453959,United,@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
681453960,United,"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
681453961,United,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
681453962,United,@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
681453963,United,@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
681453964,United,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
681453965,United,"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
681453966,United,"@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now."
681453967,United,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
681453968,United,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
681453969,United,@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
681453970,United,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
681453971,United,@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
681453972,United,@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
681453973,United,@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
681453974,United,@united @annricord both!
681453975,United,@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
681453976,United,@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
681453977,United,@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
681453978,United,"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
681453979,United,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
681453980,United,"@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
681453981,United,"@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum"
681453982,United,"@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!_� still no bag!"
681453983,United,@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
681453984,United,"@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that."
681453985,United,@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
681453986,United,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
681453987,United,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
681453988,United,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
681453989,United,@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
681453990,United,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
681453991,United,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won�۪t fix it?"
681453992,United,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won�۪t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go�_?"
681453993,United,@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
681453994,United,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
681453995,United,@united 618 was flight out of Houston
681453996,United,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
681453997,United,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
681453998,United,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
681453999,United,"@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them."

681454019,United,@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
681454020,United,@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
681454021,United,@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
681454022,United,@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
681454023,United,@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf

681454031,United,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
681454032,United,@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.

681454038,United,@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
681454039,United,"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."

681454054,United,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
681454055,United,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
681454056,United,"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
681454057,United,"@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now"
681454058,United,I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.

681454065,United,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
681454066,United,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup

681454080,United,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
681454081,United,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
681454082,United,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
681454083,United,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
681454084,United,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
681454085,United,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
681454086,United,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"

681454091,United,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
681454092,United,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
681454093,United,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
681454094,United,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
681454095,United,"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."

681454103,United,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.

681454105,United,"@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now."
681454106,United,"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
681454107,United,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
681454108,United,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
681454109,United,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
681454110,United,@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
681454111,United,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"

681454113,United,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
681454114,United,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
681454115,United,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
681454116,United,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
681454117,United,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
681454118,United,@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
681454119,United,@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
681454120,United,@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
681454121,United,@united JT thanks for your help I�۪ll complete the form once we are back home
681454122,United,"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."

681454124,United,@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
681454125,United,@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
681454126,United,"@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)"
681454127,United,@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
681454128,United,@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM

681454130,United,"@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com"
681454131,United,@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
681454132,United,"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
681454133,United,@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
681454134,United,@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
681454135,United,"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
681454136,United,@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
681454137,United,@united for our birthdays my fianc̩ &amp; I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
681454138,United,@united I�۪m resending the confirmation code in a DM
681454139,United,@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
681454140,United,@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
681454141,United,"@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?"
681454142,United,@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
681454143,United,@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
681454144,United,"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
681454145,United,@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
681454146,United,"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
681454147,United,@united worst service ever _�
681454148,United,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
681454149,United,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
681454150,United,@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
681454151,United,@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
681454152,United,@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
681454153,United,@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
681454154,United,@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground.._�...

681454157,United,"@united done just now, thanks."
681454158,United,@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
681454159,United,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
681454160,United,"@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number."
681454161,United,@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
681454162,United,"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
681454163,United,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
681454164,United,@united can you send me another confirmation email?
681454165,United,@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
681454166,United,@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
681454167,United,"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."

681454174,United,@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
681454175,United,@united customer service _�_
681454176,United,@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
681454177,United,"@united Hi again, any updates here?"
681454178,United,@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl

681454182,United,@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
681454183,United,"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
681454184,United,"@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)"

681454186,United,"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
681454187,United,@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
681454188,United,@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
681454189,United,"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
681454190,United,Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
681454191,United,"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
681454192,United,@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
681454193,United,@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
681454194,United,@united you are really trying me today.
681454195,United,@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
681454196,United,@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
681454197,United,@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
681454198,United,@united was never given one
681454199,United,@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
681454200,United,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
681454201,United,"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
681454202,United,"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
681454203,United,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
681454204,United,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
681454205,United,@united who can tell me where they are?
681454206,United,"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
681454207,United,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
681454208,United,@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
681454209,United,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
681454210,United,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
681454211,United,@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
681454212,United,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
681454213,United,@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
681454214,United,"@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam"
681454215,United,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
681454216,United,"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
681454217,United,@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
681454218,United,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
681454219,United,@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
681454220,United,@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
681454221,United,@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
681454222,United,@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
681454223,United,@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
681454224,United,"@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
681454225,United,"@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus."
681454226,United,@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
681454227,United,@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
681454228,United,"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"
681454229,United,@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
681454230,United,@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
681454231,United,"@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time"
681454232,United,@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
681454233,United,@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
681454234,United,@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
681454235,United,@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
681454236,United,@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!

681454238,United,@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
681454239,United,@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
681454240,United,@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
681454241,United,@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
681454242,United,@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
681454243,United,@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
681454244,United,@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
681454245,United,@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
681454246,United,@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
681454247,United,@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
681454248,United,@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
681454249,United,@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
681454250,United,@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
681454251,United,"@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere
magazine with out flying?"
681454252,United,@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
681454253,United,"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
681454254,United,@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
681454255,United,@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4

681454263,United,"@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?"
681454264,United,"@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?"
681454265,United,@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
681454266,United,@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
681454267,United,"@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!"
681454268,United,"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
681454269,United,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
681454270,United,@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
681454271,United,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."

681454274,United,@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!

681454277,United,@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
681454278,United,"@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +"
681454279,United,@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
681454280,United,@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
681454281,United,@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.

681454291,United,@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
681454292,United,@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
681454293,United,@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
681454294,United,@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
681454295,United,"@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE"

681455802,Southwest,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.

681457742,Delta,@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better

681457798,Delta,@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
681457799,Delta,@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
681457800,Delta,@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
681457801,Delta,@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
681457802,Delta,@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
681457803,Delta,@JetBlue Love you guys___ http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS
681457804,Delta,"@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
681457805,Delta,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
681457806,Delta,@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
681457807,Delta,"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
681457808,Delta,@JetBlue you're still the best
681457809,Delta,"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
681457810,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
681457811,Delta,"@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."
681457812,Delta,@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
681457813,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it _�
681457814,Delta,"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
681457815,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
681457816,Delta,"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
681457817,Delta,@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
681457818,Delta,@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
681457820,Delta,".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
681457821,Delta,@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
681457822,Delta,@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
681457823,Delta,@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
681457824,Delta,"@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification"
681457825,Delta,@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
681457826,Delta,@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
681457827,Delta,@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
681457828,Delta,@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
681457829,Delta,"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"
681457830,Delta,@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
681457831,Delta,@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. _� Can I tweet at the TSA??
681457832,Delta,"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
681457833,Delta,@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
681457834,Delta,@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
681457835,Delta,@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
681457836,Delta,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
681457837,Delta,@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
681457839,Delta,@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
681457840,Delta,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
681457841,Delta,@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
681457842,Delta,"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
681457843,Delta,"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
681457844,Delta,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
681457846,Delta,@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
681457847,Delta,@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
681457848,Delta,@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
681457849,Delta,@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
681457850,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
681457851,Delta,@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
681457852,Delta,@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
681457853,Delta,�@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.�۝ Me and JetBlue are #BFF _٪�

681457855,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
681457856,Delta,@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
681457857,Delta,"@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate"
681457858,Delta,@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
681457859,Delta,@JetBlue all day
681457860,Delta,@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
681457861,Delta,@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
681457862,Delta,@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
681457864,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
681457865,Delta,@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
681457866,Delta,@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
681457867,Delta,@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
681457868,Delta,@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
681457869,Delta,"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
681457870,Delta,@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
681457871,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
681457872,Delta,@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
681457873,Delta,"@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
681457874,Delta,@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
681457876,Delta,"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
681457877,Delta,@JetBlue I think I have it selected already �
681457878,Delta,"@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."
681457880,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
681457882,Delta,@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
681457884,Delta,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
681457886,Delta,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
681457890,Delta,@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
681457892,Delta,"@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?"

681457896,Delta,"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
681457897,Delta,@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
681457899,Delta,@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
681457900,Delta,@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
681457902,Delta,@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
681457905,Delta,"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
681457907,Delta,@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
681457909,Delta,@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
681457910,Delta,"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
681457912,Delta,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
681457913,Delta,@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
681457915,Delta,"@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot"

681457918,Delta,@JetBlue Pittsburgh
681457920,Delta,@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
681457922,Delta,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
681457924,Delta,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
681457926,Delta,@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
681457928,Delta,"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
681457929,Delta,@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
681457931,Delta,@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
681457932,Delta,"@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
681457934,Delta,@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
681457937,Delta,@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
681457938,Delta,@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
681457939,Delta,@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
681457941,Delta,"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
681457943,Delta,@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
681457944,Delta,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
681457946,Delta,"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
681457948,Delta,@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
681457950,Delta,"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
681457951,Delta,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
681457953,Delta,@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
681457954,Delta,"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
681457956,Delta,@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
681457958,Delta,@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
681457959,Delta,@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
681457961,Delta,"@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!"
681457963,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
681457964,Delta,@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
681457966,Delta,@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
681457967,Delta,"@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!"

681457975,Delta,@JetBlue What confirmation number?
681457976,Delta,@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
681457978,Delta,@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2

681457986,Delta,@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
681457987,Delta,@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
681457989,Delta,@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
681457990,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed

681458063,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
681458065,Delta,@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!

681458070,Delta,"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
681458071,Delta,@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
681458073,Delta,@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
681458075,Delta,"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
681458076,Delta,@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
681458078,Delta,@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
681458080,Delta,@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
681458081,Delta,@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky

681458085,Delta,@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
681458086,Delta,@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
681458088,Delta,@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
681458090,Delta,@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
681458091,Delta,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
681458095,Delta,"�@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!�۝ Thank you!"
681458097,Delta,@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
681458099,Delta,"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
681458100,Delta,.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
681458101,Delta,@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
681458103,Delta,"@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
681458104,Delta,@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
681458106,Delta,"@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"
681458108,Delta,@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
681458109,Delta,"@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy..."
681458111,Delta,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
681458113,Delta,His name is Enzo __ RT @JetBlue : @Setorii Well hello there pooch! What's your name? #dog http://t.co/dLh9138HBg
681458114,Delta,"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
681458116,Delta,@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
681458118,Delta,@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
681458119,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.

681458128,Delta,@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
681458130,Delta,"@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped."
681458132,Delta,@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
681458133,Delta,@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
681458135,Delta,@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
681458136,Delta,@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
681458138,Delta,@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
681458140,Delta,@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
681458141,Delta,@JetBlue don't I always?
681458143,Delta,@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
681458146,Delta,"@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board"
681458147,Delta,"@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
681458150,Delta,@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
681458152,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
681458154,Delta,@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
681458157,Delta,@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
681458159,Delta,"@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks"
681458160,Delta,"@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures"
681458162,Delta,@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
681458163,Delta,@JetBlue when will the system be up and running?

681458170,Delta,@JetBlue 795 to Austin
681458171,Delta,"@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!"
681458173,Delta,@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
681458175,Delta,"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
681458177,Delta,@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
681458178,Delta,@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
681458180,Delta,@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
681458182,Delta,@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
681458183,Delta,@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
681458184,Delta,"@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you"
681458186,Delta,@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
681458188,Delta,@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
681458190,Delta,@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
681458192,Delta,@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?

681458195,Delta,@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
681458198,Delta,"@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous."
681458202,Delta,@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
681458203,Delta,@JetBlue I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ
681458205,Delta,@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
681458207,Delta,@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
681458208,Delta,@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
681458210,Delta,@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
681458212,Delta,@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
681458213,Delta,@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
681458215,Delta,@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
681458217,Delta,"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
681458218,Delta,@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
681458220,Delta,@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
681458221,Delta,"@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU"
681458222,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
681458224,Delta,"@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it"
681458226,Delta,@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
681458227,Delta,@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
681458229,Delta,@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
681458231,Delta,@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
681458233,Delta,@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
681458234,Delta,"@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass"
681458236,Delta,@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
681458237,Delta,@JetBlue flight16?
681458239,Delta,@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
681458241,Delta,"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
681458242,Delta,@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
681458244,Delta,@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
681458246,Delta,@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
681458247,Delta,@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?

681458257,Delta,@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
681458258,Delta,@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
681458259,Delta,@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0

681458268,Delta,"@JetBlue thx, social media person!"
681458269,Delta,@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
681458271,Delta,@JetBlue Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours
681458273,Delta,"@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely!"
681458274,Delta,"@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!"

681458294,Delta,"@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!"
681458296,Delta,@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
681458298,Delta,@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
681458301,Delta,@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
681458304,Delta,@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.

681458324,Delta,@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
681458326,Delta,"@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight."
681458328,Delta,"@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks."

681458333,Delta,@JetBlue  I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight?
681458335,Delta,"@JetBlue  FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service"

681458355,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for getting us to NYC -JFK really safely. :-) But srsly? How long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5amMisery
681458357,Delta,@JetBlue should I expect delays at dca for 7am departure?  Going to Orlando on flight 723
681458359,Delta,@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
681458360,Delta,@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
681458362,Delta,@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
681458364,Delta,@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
681458365,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
681458367,Delta,@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. _�
681458369,Delta,@JetBlue great flight on a brand new jet. Great seating. Beautiful plane. Big fan of this airline.
681458370,Delta,@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..

681458374,Delta,@JetBlue thank you! I know the weather in #Boston isn't great. Everyone's tired
681458375,Delta,@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
681458377,Delta,@JetBlue  Alright I hope. My JetBlue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320.  Don't want any surprises
681458379,Delta,@JetBlue I know you guys are super busy but is flight 1222 an a320 or e190?
681458380,Delta,@JetBlue Follow me pls?
681458382,Delta,@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
681458384,Delta,@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
681458386,Delta,@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this
681458387,Delta,@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
681458389,Delta,@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
681458390,Delta,@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
681458392,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks for taking me back home today despite Pandora's best efforts to Cancelled Flight the flight. #jetblue #backhome #noplacelikehome
681458394,Delta,@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(

681460127,US Airways,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
681460128,US Airways,@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
681460129,US Airways,@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
681460130,US Airways,"@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to ""bad weather"" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?"
681460131,US Airways,"@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says ""due to weather�_.call back Late Flightr""  #outofbusiness ?"
681460132,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
681460134,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
681460135,US Airways,@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
681460136,US Airways,@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
681460138,US Airways,@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
681460140,US Airways,@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
681460141,US Airways,@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
681460143,US Airways,@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
681460145,US Airways,@USAirways been trying for weeks no use
681460147,US Airways,@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
681460148,US Airways,"@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE."
681460150,US Airways,@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
681460151,US Airways,@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? _٪�
681460153,US Airways,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
681460155,US Airways,"@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!"
681460156,US Airways,@USAirways How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation?
681460158,US Airways,@USAirways can i please have someone call me 781 879 4505
681460159,US Airways,@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
681460161,US Airways,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
681460163,US Airways,@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir: 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks
681460164,US Airways,@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
681460166,US Airways,@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
681460168,US Airways,@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
681460169,US Airways,@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
681460171,US Airways,@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
681460173,US Airways,@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
681460174,US Airways,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
681460176,US Airways,"@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate."
681460178,US Airways,@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
681460180,US Airways,@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
681460182,US Airways,@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
681460183,US Airways,@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
681460185,US Airways,@USAirways what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581

681460191,US Airways,"@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!"

681460196,US Airways,@USAirways flight 1946 out of clt this morning.  It's snowing here.  Should i head out to the airport?
681460199,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
681460200,US Airways,@USAirways I am a UK citizen. Is there a UK number I could try?
681460202,US Airways,@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
681460204,US Airways,@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
681460205,US Airways,@USAirways nope not yet...
681460207,US Airways,@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
681460208,US Airways,"@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic"
681460209,US Airways,@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
681460210,US Airways,@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
681460212,US Airways,@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
681460214,US Airways,@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
681460217,US Airways,@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
681460218,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
681460220,US Airways,@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
681460221,US Airways,"@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job."
681460223,US Airways,@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
681460224,US Airways,@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
681460226,US Airways,@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
681460228,US Airways,@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
681460230,US Airways,@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
681460232,US Airways,@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
681460233,US Airways,@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
681460234,US Airways,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
681460236,US Airways,@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
681460238,US Airways,@USAirways can't get back lost time
681460239,US Airways,@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
681460241,US Airways,@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
681460243,US Airways,@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
681460244,US Airways,@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!
681460246,US Airways,"@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1"
681460249,US Airways,@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
681460250,US Airways,"@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death."
681460252,US Airways,"@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note."
681460254,US Airways,@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
681460256,US Airways,@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
681460257,US Airways,@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
681460259,US Airways,@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
681460261,US Airways,@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
681460262,US Airways,@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
681460265,US Airways,@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
681460267,US Airways,"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied"
681460268,US Airways,@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
681460270,US Airways,"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
681460272,US Airways,@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
681460273,US Airways,"@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I"
681460275,US Airways,@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
681460277,US Airways,@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
681460278,US Airways,"@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo"

681460283,US Airways,@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
681460284,US Airways,@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
681460286,US Airways,@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
681460288,US Airways,"@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help."
681460290,US Airways,@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
681460292,US Airways,@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
681460293,US Airways,@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
681460295,US Airways,@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
681460297,US Airways,"@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens."
681460299,US Airways,"BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! �@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.�۝"
681460300,US Airways,@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
681460302,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
681460304,US Airways,"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"

681460314,US Airways,@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
681460315,US Airways,"@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.

681460331,US Airways,@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
681460333,US Airways,@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
681460336,US Airways,@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.

681460349,US Airways,"@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable."

681460356,US Airways,"@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it."
681460357,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
681460358,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak
681460359,US Airways,@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?

681460366,US Airways,@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
681460368,US Airways,@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
681460370,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
681460372,US Airways,"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
681460374,US Airways,@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
681460376,US Airways,@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
681460377,US Airways,@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.

681460381,US Airways,@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
681460382,US Airways,@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
681460384,US Airways,"@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers"
681460386,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
681460389,US Airways,@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
681460391,US Airways,@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
681460392,US Airways,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
681460394,US Airways,@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
681460396,US Airways,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
681460397,US Airways,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
681460399,US Airways,@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
681460401,US Airways,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
681460402,US Airways,@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
681460404,US Airways,@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
681460406,US Airways,@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
681460407,US Airways,"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
681460409,US Airways,"Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options."
681460411,US Airways,@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
681460412,US Airways,"@USAirways should, but didn�۪t."
681460414,US Airways,@USAirways just now but no general announcement
681460415,US Airways,@USAirways what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte?
681460417,US Airways,@USAirways I�۪d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
681460419,US Airways,@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
681460420,US Airways,@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
681460422,US Airways,@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
681460424,US Airways,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
681460426,US Airways,@USAirways very embarrassing.
681460428,US Airways,@USAirways I�۪m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn�۪t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
681460429,US Airways,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... _� what about the impossible connection that started this?
681460430,US Airways,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
681460432,US Airways,@USAirways and despite tailwind�_ Will still be Late Flight.
681460433,US Airways,@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
681460435,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
681460437,US Airways,"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
681460439,US Airways,@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
681460441,US Airways,@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
681460443,US Airways,@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
681460444,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
681460446,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused
681460448,US Airways,"@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight."
681460449,US Airways,"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
681460451,US Airways,@USAirways I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you.
681460453,US Airways,"@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?"
681460454,US Airways,@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
681460456,US Airways,@USAirways  can you help me out?
681460458,US Airways,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
681460459,US Airways,@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
681460461,US Airways,"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
681460463,US Airways,@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
681460464,US Airways,@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
681460466,US Airways,@usairways &amp; @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr
681460468,US Airways,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
681460469,US Airways,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
681460471,US Airways,"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
681460473,US Airways,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
681460475,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
681460476,US Airways,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes�_ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
681460478,US Airways,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
681460480,US Airways,"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said �It is now.�۝ But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
681460481,US Airways,"@USAirways while I�۪m asking�_ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat."
681460483,US Airways,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
681460486,US Airways,@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
681460487,US Airways,@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
681460490,US Airways,@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
681460493,US Airways,.@USAirways Have you just given up?
681460495,US Airways,.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
681460497,US Airways,@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
681460498,US Airways,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
681460499,US Airways,Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
681460501,US Airways,@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
681460503,US Airways,@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
681460505,US Airways,@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute
681460507,US Airways,@USAirways New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/WbhbljJkS7
681460508,US Airways,@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
681460510,US Airways,@USAirways can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please.
681460512,US Airways,@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
681460514,US Airways,@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
681460515,US Airways,@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
681460517,US Airways,@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
681460519,US Airways,"@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, &amp; picked ""Standby for 1st"" I was not put on the list?"
681460520,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
681460522,US Airways,@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
681460523,US Airways,"@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!"
681460525,US Airways,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
681460526,US Airways,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
681460528,US Airways,@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
681460530,US Airways,@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
681460532,US Airways,@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
681460534,US Airways,@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
681460535,US Airways,@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
681460537,US Airways,@USAirways ok thanks
681460539,US Airways,@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
681460540,US Airways,@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
681460544,US Airways,@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
681460546,US Airways,@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
681460547,US Airways,"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"
681460549,US Airways,@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
681460551,US Airways,@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
681460552,US Airways,@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
681460553,US Airways,"@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos."
681460555,US Airways,@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
681460557,US Airways,@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
681460558,US Airways,"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
681460560,US Airways,@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
681460562,US Airways,@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
681460563,US Airways,@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
681460565,US Airways,@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
681460567,US Airways,@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
681460568,US Airways,@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
681460570,US Airways,@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags
681460571,US Airways,@USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again
681460572,US Airways,@USAirways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road
681460573,US Airways,@USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock.
681460575,US Airways,@USAirways power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was
681460577,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on.

681460580,US Airways,@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
681460582,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
681460583,US Airways,"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
681460585,US Airways,@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
681460588,US Airways,@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
681460589,US Airways,@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
681460591,US Airways,@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
681460594,US Airways,@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
681460595,US Airways,"@USAirways Am I allowed to carry on a suit bag and carry on bag? My suit bag will hang like a jacket would. It is soft sided, 48"""
681460597,US Airways,@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!

681460600,US Airways,@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
681460602,US Airways,@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
681460604,US Airways,@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
681460605,US Airways,@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
681460607,US Airways,@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
681460608,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
681460610,US Airways,"@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
681460612,US Airways,@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
681460614,US Airways,@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
681460615,US Airways,@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
681460617,US Airways,@USAirways following you now
681460618,US Airways,@USAirways sorry I didn't realize I wasn't following you
681460620,US Airways,@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
681460621,US Airways,@USAirways I made it! Thanks for the help!
681460623,US Airways,@USAirways - Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
681460624,US Airways,"@USAirways is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs , shoes, and golf balls, if that's the only piece of luggage you check?"

681460626,US Airways,@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
681460628,US Airways,@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
681460630,US Airways,@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
681460631,US Airways,"@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?"
681460633,US Airways,"@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would."
681460635,US Airways,@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
681460636,US Airways,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
681460638,US Airways,@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
681460640,US Airways,@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
681460643,US Airways,@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
681460645,US Airways,@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
681460647,US Airways,@USAirways too Late Flight.
681460648,US Airways,@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
681460649,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
681460650,US Airways,@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
681460652,US Airways,@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
681460654,US Airways,@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
681460655,US Airways,"@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully."
681460657,US Airways,"@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)"
681460659,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
681460661,US Airways,@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
681460663,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
681460664,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
681460666,US Airways,"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
681460668,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
681460669,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. ""Look, over there to the left!"" Actual announcement."
681460671,US Airways,@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
681460672,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
681460674,US Airways,@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
681460676,US Airways,@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
681460678,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
681460679,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)"
681460681,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
681460683,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
681460685,US Airways,@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
681460686,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
681460688,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
681460690,US Airways,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
681460691,US Airways,@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
681460694,US Airways,@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
681460696,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
681460698,US Airways,@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
681460699,US Airways,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
681460701,US Airways,"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
681460703,US Airways,"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
681460704,US Airways,@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
681460706,US Airways,@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
681460707,US Airways,@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
681460709,US Airways,"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."
681460711,US Airways,"@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?"
681460713,US Airways,@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
681460715,US Airways,"@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx."
681460717,US Airways,@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
681460718,US Airways,@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
681460720,US Airways,"@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go."
681460721,US Airways,@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
681460722,US Airways,@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
681460723,US Airways,"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
681460724,US Airways,@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
681460725,US Airways,"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
681460726,US Airways,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
681460727,US Airways,@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
681460728,US Airways,@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
681460729,US Airways,@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
681460730,US Airways,@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
681460731,US Airways,"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
681460732,US Airways,@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!

681460734,US Airways,@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
681460735,US Airways,@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
681460736,US Airways,@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
681460737,US Airways,@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
681460738,US Airways,@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! _�ԍ
681460739,US Airways,"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
681460740,US Airways,@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
681460741,US Airways,@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
681460742,US Airways,"@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight"
681460743,US Airways,@USAirways trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday?
681460744,US Airways,"@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service"
681460745,US Airways,"@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways"

681460747,US Airways,"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
681460748,US Airways,"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"
681460749,US Airways,@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
681460750,US Airways,@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
681460751,US Airways,@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
681460752,US Airways,@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
681460753,US Airways,@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
681460754,US Airways,@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
681460755,US Airways,@USAirways how long for a reply
681460756,US Airways,@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
681460757,US Airways,@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
681460758,US Airways,@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
681460759,US Airways,@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
681460760,US Airways,@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
681460761,US Airways,@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
681460762,US Airways,.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
681460763,US Airways,"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
681460764,US Airways,"@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?"

681460916,US Airways,@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
681460917,US Airways,"@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again."
681460918,US Airways,@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
681460919,US Airways,@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
681460920,US Airways,@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long_�
681460921,US Airways,@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
681460922,US Airways,@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
681460923,US Airways,@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
681460924,US Airways,@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
681460925,US Airways,@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
681460926,US Airways,@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
681460927,US Airways,@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
681460928,US Airways,@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
681460929,US Airways,"@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience"
681460930,US Airways,@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
681460931,US Airways,@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
681460932,US Airways,@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
681460933,US Airways,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
681460934,US Airways,@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
681460935,US Airways,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
681460936,US Airways,@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
681460937,US Airways,"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"
681460938,US Airways,"@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area."
681460939,US Airways,@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
681460940,US Airways,@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
681460941,US Airways,"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
681460942,US Airways,@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
681460943,US Airways,"@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!"
681460944,US Airways,"@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat...."
681460945,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
681460946,US Airways,"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled."
681460947,US Airways,@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
681460948,US Airways,@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
681460949,US Airways,@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight

681460959,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
681460960,US Airways,@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
681460961,US Airways,@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?

681461946,US Airways,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
681461947,US Airways,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
681461948,US Airways,"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."

681462040,US Airways,"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"

681462185,US Airways,"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
681462186,US Airways,"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
681462187,US Airways,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
681462188,US Airways,@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
681462189,US Airways,@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
681462190,US Airways,"@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL"
681462191,US Airways,@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
681462192,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
681462193,US Airways,@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
681462194,US Airways,@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
681462195,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
681462196,US Airways,"@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed."
681462197,US Airways,@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
681462198,US Airways,@USAirways Done
681462199,US Airways,@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
681462200,US Airways,@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
681462201,US Airways,"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
681462202,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
681462203,US Airways,@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
681462204,US Airways,@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
681462205,US Airways,"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
681462206,US Airways,"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of �We don�۪t care. We�۪re automated."""
681462207,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"
681462208,US Airways,@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
681462209,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
681462210,US Airways,@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
681462211,US Airways,@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
681462212,US Airways,@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
681462213,US Airways,@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
681462214,US Airways,@USAirways what is the damn delay????
681462215,US Airways,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
681462216,US Airways,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
681462217,US Airways,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
681462218,US Airways,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
681462219,US Airways,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
681462221,US Airways,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
681462222,US Airways,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
681462223,US Airways,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
681462224,US Airways,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
681462225,US Airways,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
681462226,US Airways,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
681462227,US Airways,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
681462228,US Airways,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
681462229,US Airways,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
681462230,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
681462231,US Airways,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
681462232,US Airways,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
681462233,US Airways,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
681462234,US Airways,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! �ە�
681462235,US Airways,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
681462236,US Airways,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
681462237,US Airways,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
681462238,US Airways,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
681462239,US Airways,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
681462240,US Airways,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
681462241,US Airways,@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
681462242,US Airways,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
681462243,US Airways,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
681462244,US Airways,"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
681462245,US Airways,@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
681462246,US Airways,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
681462247,US Airways,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
681462248,US Airways,"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"
681462249,US Airways,@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
681462250,US Airways,"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
681462251,US Airways,@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
681462252,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
681462253,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
681462254,US Airways,@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
681462255,US Airways,@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
681462256,US Airways,@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
681462257,US Airways,@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
681462258,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
681462259,US Airways,@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
681462260,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
681462261,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
681462262,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
681462263,US Airways,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
681462264,US Airways,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
681462265,US Airways,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
681462266,US Airways,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
681462267,US Airways,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
681462268,US Airways,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
681462269,US Airways,"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
681462270,US Airways,@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
681462271,US Airways,@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
681462272,US Airways,@USAirways I am following you now
681462273,US Airways,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
681462274,US Airways,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
681462275,US Airways,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
681462276,US Airways,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
681462277,US Airways,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
681462278,US Airways,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
681462279,US Airways,"�@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?�۝ Spring Break !!!"
681462280,US Airways,@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
681462281,US Airways,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
681462283,US Airways,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. _�
681462284,US Airways,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
681462285,US Airways,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
681462286,US Airways,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
681462287,US Airways,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
681462288,US Airways,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
681462289,US Airways,@USAirways I�۪ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
681462290,US Airways,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
681462291,US Airways,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys�_see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
681462292,US Airways,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
681462293,US Airways,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
681462294,US Airways,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
681462295,US Airways,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
681462296,US Airways,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
681462297,US Airways,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
681462298,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
681462299,US Airways,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
681462300,US Airways,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
681462301,US Airways,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
681462302,US Airways,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
681462303,US Airways,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
681462304,US Airways,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
681462305,US Airways,@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
681462306,US Airways,"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
681462307,US Airways,"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection�_ Help!"
681462308,US Airways,@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
681462309,US Airways,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
681462310,US Airways,@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
681462311,US Airways,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
681462312,US Airways,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
681462313,US Airways,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
681462314,US Airways,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
681462315,US Airways,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
681462316,US Airways,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
681462317,US Airways,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
681462318,US Airways,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
681462319,US Airways,"@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
681462320,US Airways,"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
681462321,US Airways,@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
681462322,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
681462323,US Airways,@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
681462324,US Airways,"@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!"
681462325,US Airways,@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
681462326,US Airways,"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
681462327,US Airways,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
681462328,US Airways,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
681462329,US Airways,"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
681462330,US Airways,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
681462331,US Airways,@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
681462332,US Airways,"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
681462333,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
681462334,US Airways,"@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE."
681462335,US Airways,@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
681462336,US Airways,@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
681462337,US Airways,"@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost"
681462338,US Airways,"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
681462339,US Airways,"@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ"
681462340,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
681462341,US Airways,@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
681462342,US Airways,@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
681462343,US Airways,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
681462344,US Airways,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
681462345,US Airways,"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
681462346,US Airways,@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
681462347,US Airways,"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)"
681462348,US Airways,@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
681462349,US Airways,@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
681462350,US Airways,"@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?"
681462351,US Airways,@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
681462352,US Airways,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
681462353,US Airways,@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
681462354,US Airways,@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
681462355,US Airways,@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
681462356,US Airways,"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"
681462357,US Airways,@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
681462358,US Airways,@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I�۪ve been on flight 1776 from BOS �&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
681462359,US Airways,"@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?"
681462360,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
681462361,US Airways,@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
681462362,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
681462363,US Airways,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
681462364,US Airways,@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
681462365,US Airways,@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
681462366,US Airways,@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
681462367,US Airways,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
681462368,US Airways,@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
681462369,US Airways,@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning.
681462370,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
681462371,US Airways,@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
681462372,US Airways,@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
681462373,US Airways,@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
681462374,US Airways,@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
681462375,US Airways,@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
681462376,US Airways,@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
681462377,US Airways,@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
681462378,US Airways,@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
681462379,US Airways,@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
681462380,US Airways,.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
681462381,US Airways,@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection _�
681462382,US Airways,"@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates"
681462383,US Airways,@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
681462384,US Airways,"@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,"
681462385,US Airways,@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
681462386,US Airways,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
681462387,US Airways,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
681462388,US Airways,@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
681462389,US Airways,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
681462390,US Airways,@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
681462391,US Airways,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
681462392,US Airways,@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
681462393,US Airways,@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
681462394,US Airways,@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
681462395,US Airways,@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
681462396,US Airways,@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
681462397,US Airways,@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
681462398,US Airways,"@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival"
681462399,US Airways,"@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more"
681462400,US Airways,"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."
681462401,US Airways,@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
681462402,US Airways,@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
681462403,US Airways,"�@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.�۝ Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt"
681462404,US Airways,@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
681462405,US Airways,@USAirways lol me too
681462406,US Airways,@USAirways still waiting on a response
681462407,US Airways,@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
681462408,US Airways,@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
681462409,US Airways,@USAirways How will I change it?
681462410,US Airways,@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
681462411,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
681462412,US Airways,"@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?"
681462413,US Airways,"@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!"
681462414,US Airways,@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
681462415,US Airways,@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
681462416,US Airways,@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
681462417,US Airways,@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
681462418,US Airways,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"
681462419,US Airways,"@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad."
681462420,US Airways,@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
681462421,US Airways,@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
681462422,US Airways,@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
681462423,US Airways,"@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft."
681462424,US Airways,"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
681462425,US Airways,@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
681462426,US Airways,@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
681462427,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
681462428,US Airways,@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
681462429,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way."
681462430,US Airways,@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
681462431,US Airways,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
681462432,US Airways,@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
681462433,US Airways,@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day
681462434,US Airways,@USAirways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18
681462435,US Airways,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
681462436,US Airways,@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
681462437,US Airways,"@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?"
681462438,US Airways,@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
681462439,US Airways,@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO _�_�_�_�
681462440,US Airways,@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.

681462445,US Airways,@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
681462446,US Airways,@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!

681462456,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
681462457,US Airways,@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
681462458,US Airways,@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
681462459,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!!"
681462460,US Airways,"@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery"

http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn"
681462462,US Airways,@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
681462463,US Airways,@USAirways is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP
681462464,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful

681462474,US Airways,"@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?"
681462475,US Airways,@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
681462476,US Airways,@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
681462477,US Airways,@USAirways #tbt every day.
681462478,US Airways,@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?

681462549,US Airways,@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
681462550,US Airways,@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
681462551,US Airways,"@USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.."

681462554,US Airways,@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
681462555,US Airways,"@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV"
681462556,US Airways,@USAirways Will do :)
681462557,US Airways,@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
681462558,US Airways,@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
681462559,US Airways,"@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags"

681462563,US Airways,@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
681462564,US Airways,@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
681462565,US Airways,@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
681462566,US Airways,@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it
681462567,US Airways,@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
681462568,US Airways,@USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?

681462570,US Airways,@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
681462571,US Airways,"@USAirways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight."
681462572,US Airways,@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
681462573,US Airways,@USAirways will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit?
681462574,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
681462575,US Airways,@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
681462576,US Airways,@USAirways I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging?
681462577,US Airways,@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
681462578,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
681462579,US Airways,@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
681462580,US Airways,"@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back"
681462581,US Airways,@USAirways really!??
681462582,US Airways,@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her
681462583,US Airways,@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
681462584,US Airways,"@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!"
681462585,US Airways,@USAirways no your not!
681462586,US Airways,@USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled
681462587,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
681462588,US Airways,@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
681462589,US Airways,@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
681462590,US Airways,@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
681462591,US Airways,@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
681462592,US Airways,@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
681462593,US Airways,@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
681462594,US Airways,@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
681462595,US Airways,@USAirways delays to the max
681462596,US Airways,@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
681462597,US Airways,@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
681462598,US Airways,@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
681462599,US Airways,"@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected."
681462600,US Airways,@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
681462601,US Airways,@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
681462602,US Airways,@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
681462603,US Airways,@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
681462604,US Airways,@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
681462605,US Airways,@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
681462606,US Airways,@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
681462607,US Airways,@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
681462608,US Airways,@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
681462609,US Airways,@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
681462610,US Airways,@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
681462611,US Airways,@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
681462612,US Airways,@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
681462613,US Airways,@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
681462614,US Airways,@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
681462615,US Airways,"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
681462616,US Airways,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
681462618,US Airways,"@USAirways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change"
681462619,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?"
681462620,US Airways,@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
681462621,US Airways,@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
681462622,US Airways,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
681462623,US Airways,@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
681462624,US Airways,@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
681462625,US Airways,@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.
681462626,US Airways,@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
681462627,US Airways,"@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where..."
681462628,US Airways,@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
681462629,US Airways,@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
681462630,US Airways,@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
681462631,US Airways,@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
681462632,US Airways,@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
681462633,US Airways,@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
681462634,US Airways,�@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.�۝ Confirmation code?
681462635,US Airways,@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier
681462636,US Airways,"@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?"
681462637,US Airways,@USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.
681462638,US Airways,@USAirways my TSA precheck isn't showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow...help!? #USAirways #TSAPreCheck
681462639,US Airways,"@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :("
681462640,US Airways,@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
681462641,US Airways,@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
681462642,US Airways,@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
681462643,US Airways,"@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks"
681462644,US Airways,@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
681462645,US Airways,"@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good"
681462646,US Airways,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
681462647,US Airways,"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."
681462648,US Airways,@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
681462649,US Airways,@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
681462650,US Airways,@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
681462651,US Airways,@USAirways Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything
681462652,US Airways,"@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v"
681462653,US Airways,"@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided."
681462654,US Airways,@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
681462655,US Airways,@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
681462656,US Airways,@USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready
681462657,US Airways,"@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic"
681462658,US Airways,"@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate"
681462659,US Airways,@USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!
681462660,US Airways,@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far

681462685,US Airways,@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?
681462686,US Airways,@USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them
681462687,US Airways,@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
681462688,US Airways,@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
681462689,US Airways,@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
681462690,US Airways,@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
681462691,US Airways,@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
681462692,US Airways,@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
681462693,US Airways,@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
681462694,US Airways,@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
681462695,US Airways,@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
681462696,US Airways,@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
681462697,US Airways,"@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!"
681462698,US Airways,@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
681462699,US Airways,@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
681462700,US Airways,@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
681462701,US Airways,@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
681462702,US Airways,@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
681462703,US Airways,"@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off."
681462704,US Airways,@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
681462705,US Airways,@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
681462706,US Airways,"@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher"
681462707,US Airways,"@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer."
681462708,US Airways,@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
681462709,US Airways,@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
681462710,US Airways,@USAirways that wasn۪t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you۪re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
681462711,US Airways,@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
681462712,US Airways,Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
681462713,US Airways,@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in�_ 40 mins�_ and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
681462714,US Airways,@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
681462715,US Airways,"@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks"
681462716,US Airways,@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
681462717,US Airways,"@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain"
681462718,US Airways,"@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone."
681462719,US Airways,@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
681462720,US Airways,@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
681462721,US Airways,"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
681462722,US Airways,@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
681462723,US Airways,@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
681462724,US Airways,@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck

681462738,US Airways,@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
681462739,US Airways,"@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again"
681462740,US Airways,@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
681462741,US Airways,"@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!"
681462742,US Airways,"@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks."
681462743,US Airways,@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
681462744,US Airways,@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
681462745,US Airways,"@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options"
681462746,US Airways,@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
681462747,US Airways,@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
681462748,US Airways,"@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?"
681462749,US Airways,@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.

681462754,US Airways,@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
681462755,US Airways,"@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request"

681462936,US Airways,@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
681462937,US Airways,@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.

681677524,American,@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
681677525,American,@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
681677526,American,@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
681677527,American,@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
681677528,American,@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
681677529,American,"@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."
681677530,American,"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."

681677541,American,"@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."
681677542,American,@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
681677543,American,@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
681677544,American,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
681677545,American,"@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that"

681677716,American,"@AmericanAir just curious. Thanks for the response as always, good or bad. Better than your competition."
681677717,American,@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
681677718,American,@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
681677719,American,@AmericanAir - thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice
681677720,American,@AmericanAir Thanks!

681677725,American,.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
681677726,American,@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
681677727,American,"@AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm."

681677735,American,@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
681677736,American,@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.

681677750,American,"@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?"

681677764,American,@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
681677765,American,"@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral."

681677810,American,"@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed."

681677819,American,@AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
681677820,American,Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
681677821,American,@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
681677822,American,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
681677823,American,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
681677824,American,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
681677825,American,@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
681677826,American,@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
681677827,American,@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
681677828,American,@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
681677829,American,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
681677830,American,@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
681677831,American,@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.

681677845,American,@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
681677846,American,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
681677847,American,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting

681677859,American,"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
681677860,American,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.

681677862,American,@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami

681677869,American,@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting

681678056,American,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
681678057,American,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
681678058,American,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
681678059,American,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?

681678121,American,"@AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic"

681678125,American,@AmericanAir Thank you so much.

681678127,American,@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
681678128,American,@AmericanAir What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.

681678130,American,"@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!"
681678131,American,@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
681678132,American,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
681678133,American,@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
681678134,American,"@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant"
681678135,American,@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
681678136,American,@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
681678137,American,@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
681678138,American,"@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!"
681678139,American,@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
681678140,American,@AmericanAir thank you for the assistance

681678151,American,@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
681678152,American,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
681678153,American,"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
681678154,American,@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?
681678155,American,"@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r"
681678156,American,@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
681678157,American,@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
681678158,American,@AmericanAir I had booked online but unable to Cancelled Flight online. But finally got thru.
681678159,American,@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
681678160,American,@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
681678161,American,@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
681678162,American,@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
681678163,American,@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
681678164,American,@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
681678165,American,@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
681678166,American,"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
681678167,American,@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
681678168,American,"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
681678169,American,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
681678170,American,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
681678171,American,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
681678172,American,"@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
681678173,American,@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
681678174,American,"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
681678175,American,"@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work."
681678176,American,"@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!"
681678177,American,"@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call."
681678178,American,@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
681678179,American,"@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!"
681678180,American,"@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour."
681678181,American,@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
681678182,American,"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice"
681678183,American,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
681678184,American,@AmericanAir thanks
681678185,American,@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
681678186,American,@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
681678187,American,@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
681678188,American,@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! _�ԍ_�ԍ_�ԍ_�ԍ_�ԍ

681678193,American,@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
681678194,American,@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
681678195,American,"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
681678196,American,"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
681678197,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks for asking On second plane after maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. Sitting at gate in very very warm plane"

681678207,American,@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
681678208,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?"

681678221,American,@AmericanAir not helpful
681678222,American,"@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt"
681678223,American,"@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't."
681678224,American,@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
681678225,American,@AmericanAir well you spelled my name wrong.
681678226,American,"@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold"
681678227,American,@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
681678228,American,@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
681678229,American,"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
681678230,American,"@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM"
681678231,American,@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!

681678244,American,@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up�_
681678245,American,@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
681678246,American,@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
681678247,American,@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
681678248,American,@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
681678249,American,"@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight."
681678250,American,@AmericanAir All of the nicest people in the world work at Admiral's clubs. Gladys in San Juan es mi Amiga

681678255,American,@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
681678256,American,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
681678257,American,"@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day."
681678258,American,@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??

681678265,American,@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
681678266,American,@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
681678267,American,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"

681678502,American,@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
681678503,American,"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
681678504,American,"@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable"

681678518,American,@AmericanAir how can I get travel question answered quickly... Online and calling not helping with this busy day
681678519,American,"@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: ""can I have some water?"" ""no we don't do that. please take your seat"""
681678520,American,"@AmericanAir The website won't let me view my reservation due to ""changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY"". I'm on hold now to get help."
681678521,American,@AmericanAir I meant can you use the 50k bonus sign up mileage for Alaska flights or only American?

681678532,American,@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
681678533,American,@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
681678534,American,"@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch"
681678535,American,@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
681678536,American,@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
681678537,American,@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
681678538,American,"@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire"

681678541,American,@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
681678542,American,@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
681678543,American,@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
681678544,American,@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
681678545,American,@AmericanAir BRING MY FIANC� @meerikangas BACK TO ME!
681678546,American,@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
681678547,American,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
681678548,American,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
681678549,American,@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
681678550,American,@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
681678551,American,@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
681678552,American,@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable _�
681678553,American,@AmericanAir are you anticipating weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightations for afternoon departures out of AUS today?
681678554,American,@AmericanAir No worries. Don't blame you for weather.
681678555,American,@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!
681678556,American,"@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted"
681678557,American,@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
681678558,American,@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
681678559,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"
681678560,American,@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
681678561,American,"@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent."
681678562,American,@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
681678563,American,@AmericanAir I need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow
681678564,American,@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
681678565,American,@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
681678566,American,"@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can"""
681678567,American,@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
681678568,American,@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
681678569,American,@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
681678570,American,@AmericanAir - trying to track down backs for two of my attendees #help
681678571,American,@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
681678572,American,@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
681678573,American,@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
681678574,American,"@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice"
681678575,American,@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
681678576,American,@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?
681678577,American,@AmericanAir thanks for responding ... will do!
681678578,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology"
681678579,American,@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
681678580,American,@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
681678581,American,@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers

681678584,American,@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
681678585,American,"@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.
Direct email?"
681678586,American,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a   brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
681678587,American,"@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love..."
681678588,American,@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
681678589,American,@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
681678590,American,"@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye""."
681678591,American,@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
681678592,American,@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
681678593,American,@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
681678594,American,@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.

681678599,American,@AmericanAir thank you!
681678600,American,@AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.
681678601,American,"@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet."
681678602,American,"@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!"
681678603,American,@AmericanAir in miami and the  agents Rachel Wong and Marisol Pimentel were very  pleasant in a world of chaos a BIG .thank u
681678604,American,@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
681678605,American,@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
681678606,American,@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
681678607,American,@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
681678608,American,@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
681678609,American,@AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
681678610,American,@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.

681678612,American,.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
681678613,American,"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."
681678614,American,@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
681678615,American,@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
681678616,American,@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
681678617,American,@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
681678618,American,@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
681678619,American,@AmericanAir do you know if there is wifi on this flight? If so how much is it? Thank you :-)
681678620,American,@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!

681678622,American,@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
681678623,American,@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
681678624,American,@AmericanAir Will 2396 be Cancelled Flightled tonight?
681678625,American,"@AmericanAir Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst"
681678626,American,@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.

681678654,American,"@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?"
681678655,American,@AmericanAir is DFW accepting any arrivals or departures today?
681678656,American,"@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?"

681678687,American,@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
681678688,American,@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.

681678744,American,@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
681678745,American,"@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever."
681678746,American,@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
681678747,American,@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather�

681678749,American,@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!

681678765,American,@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
681678766,American,@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
681678767,American,@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
681678768,American,"@AmericanAir we have been rebooked due to weather, but need to change our reservation and fly on the 24th, instead of the 23rd."

681678786,American,@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
681678787,American,@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
681678788,American,"@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks"
681678789,American,@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
681678790,American,@AmericanAir me because it might not be so urgent for you but it really is for me. (5)
681678791,American,@AmericanAir i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)

681678805,American,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
681678806,American,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
681678807,American,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
681678808,American,"@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that..."
681678809,American,@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
681678810,American,@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
681678811,American,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
681678812,American,@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
681678813,American,@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
681678814,American,@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
681678815,American,"@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!"

681678837,American,@AmericanAir make sure u insure your luggage as those assholes @ AA take no fricken responsibility...&amp; don't  believe their lies!!!!
681678838,American,@AmericanAir-everyone: its been weeks&amp;those dickheads @ AA hadn't contacted me...they lost my checked bag &amp; carryon and haven't offer to pay

681678840,American,@AmericanAir 235.  We made it to Seattle...
681678841,American,@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
681678842,American,@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
681678843,American,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
681678844,American,@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
681678845,American,@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
681678846,American,@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
681678847,American,@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
681678848,American,"@AmericanAir To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately."
681678849,American,"@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2"

681678851,American,@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending

681678853,American,@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
681678854,American,@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
681678855,American,"@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?"
681678856,American,@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.

681678867,American,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
681678868,American,"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?"
681678869,American,"@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service"
681678870,American,@AmericanAir Flight 4606 from MEM to DCA delayed 6 hours! Now holding breath while they keep me trapped 3 hours to de-ice. #scareair

681678881,American,@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating

681678883,American,@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
681678884,American,@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
681678885,American,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
681678886,American,@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
681678887,American,@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?

681679074,American,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
681679075,American,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
681679076,American,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
681679077,American,"@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service"
681679078,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
681679079,American,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
681679080,American,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
681679081,American,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
681679082,American,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
681679083,American,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
681679084,American,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
681679085,American,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
681679086,American,@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
681679087,American,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
681679088,American,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
681679089,American,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
681679090,American,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
681679091,American,@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
681679092,American,"@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding."

681679104,American,@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
681679105,American,@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
681679106,American,@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
681679107,American,@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
681679108,American,@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad

681679112,American,@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
681679113,American,@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
681679114,American,"@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!"

681679116,American,"@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!"
681679117,American,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
681679118,American,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
681679119,American,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
681679120,American,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
681679121,American,@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation
681679122,American,"@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!"
681679123,American,@AmericanAir thanks to Marie for reFlight Booking Problems me and my friends!!! I'm Cali bound thanks to this sweet angel! #blessed
681679124,American,@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
681679125,American,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
681679126,American,"@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags"
681679127,American,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
681679128,American,@AmericanAir its Adolfo Garcia
681679129,American,"@AmericanAir My friend needs some help on her flt (she's not on Twiiter), can I DM you her info?"
681679130,American,"@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"
681679131,American,@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
681679132,American,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
681679133,American,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
681679134,American,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
681679135,American,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
681679136,American,@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
681679137,American,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
681679138,American,@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
681679139,American,@AmericanAir I know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @AUStinAirport
681679140,American,@AmericanAir And gold status too.
681679141,American,@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
681679142,American,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
681679143,American,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
681679144,American,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
681679145,American,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
681679146,American,@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
681679147,American,@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
681679148,American,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
681679149,American,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
681679150,American,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
681679151,American,@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
681679152,American,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
681679153,American,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
681679154,American,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
681679155,American,@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
681679156,American,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
681679157,American,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
681679158,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."
681679159,American,Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
681679160,American,@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
681679161,American,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
681679162,American,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
681679163,American,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
681679164,American,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
681679165,American,@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
681679166,American,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
681679167,American,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
681679168,American,@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
681679169,American,@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
681679170,American,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane _�_�_�_ #AmericanAirlines"
681679171,American,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
681679172,American,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
681679173,American,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
681679174,American,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
681679175,American,@AmericanAir American Airlines.
681679176,American,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
681679177,American,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
681679178,American,@AmericanAir I just DMed you
681679179,American,@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
681679180,American,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
681679181,American,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
681679182,American,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
681679183,American,@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
681679184,American,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
681679185,American,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful _�_"
681679186,American,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
681679187,American,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
681679188,American,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
681679189,American,"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
681679190,American,@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
681679191,American,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
681679192,American,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
681679193,American,@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
681679194,American,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
681679195,American,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
681679196,American,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
681679197,American,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
681679198,American,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
681679199,American,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
681679200,American,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
681679201,American,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
681679202,American,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
681679203,American,@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
681679204,American,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y�۪all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
681679205,American,@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
681679206,American,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you�۪ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
681679207,American,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
681679208,American,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
681679209,American,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
681679210,American,"@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
681679211,American,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
681679212,American,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
681679213,American,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though _� I'm really mad about the situation"
681679214,American,"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"

681679220,American,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
681679221,American,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
681679222,American,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
681679223,American,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
681679224,American,"@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!"
681679225,American,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
681679226,American,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
681679227,American,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....

681679241,American,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
681679242,American,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
681679243,American,"@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z"
681679244,American,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
681679245,American,@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!

681679252,American,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
681679253,American,@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know

681679261,American,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
681679262,American,@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
681679263,American,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
681679264,American,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
681679265,American,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
681679266,American,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
681679267,American,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
681679268,American,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
681679269,American,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
681679270,American,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
681679271,American,@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
681679272,American,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.

681679274,American,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
681679275,American,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
681679276,American,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
681679277,American,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
681679278,American,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
681679279,American,@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
681679280,American,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
681679281,American,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
681679282,American,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
681679283,American,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
681679284,American,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
681679285,American,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
681679286,American,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
681679287,American,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
681679288,American,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
681679289,American,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
681679290,American,@AmericanAir Close down
681679291,American,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
681679292,American,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
681679293,American,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
681679294,American,@AmericanAir I�۪ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
681679295,American,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
681679296,American,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
681679297,American,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
681679299,American,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
681679300,American,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
681679301,American,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
681679302,American,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
681679303,American,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
681679304,American,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
681679305,American,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
681679306,American,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
681679307,American,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
681679308,American,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
681679309,American,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
681679310,American,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
681679311,American,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
681679312,American,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
681679313,American,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
681679314,American,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
681679315,American,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
681679316,American,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
681679317,American,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
681679318,American,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
681679319,American,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
681679320,American,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
681679321,American,@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
681679322,American,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
681679323,American,"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
681679324,American,"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
681679325,American,@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck

681679327,American,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
681679328,American,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
681679329,American,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
681679330,American,@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
681679331,American,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
681679332,American,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
681679333,American,"@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying ""standby"""
681679334,American,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
681679335,American,"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
681679336,American,@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
681679337,American,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
681679338,American,@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
681679339,American,@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
681679340,American,"@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w"

681679343,American,@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus

681679345,American,@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
681679346,American,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
681679347,American,"@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed"
681679348,American,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
681679349,American,@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
681679350,American,"@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?"
681679351,American,@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
681679352,American,@AmericanAir What's the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday?

681679363,American,@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
